Setting up notdNetHack:

notdNetHack is currently only supported on Unix, including WSL for Windows, with no plans to change this for the foreseeable future.

For compiling on Windows:
* Download Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
* Open the Terminal in WSL. (Just clicking on the shortcut opens the terminal)
* Navigate (using `ls` and `cd`) to where you want to install notdnethack
* Install git: `apt install git`
* Download the version of dNAO you want with git: `git clone https://github.com/demogorgon22/notdnethack.git` will get you whatever is the default release branch is at the time
* Install the following using `apt install <XXXX>`: `bison`, `build-essential`, `libncurses5-dev`, `flex`
  * If you want to rebuild `include/macromagic.h` (this is only required if you modify `util/MacroMagicMarker.py` or `doc/macromagic.txt`), you also need `python3`
* Build & install by typing `make install`
  * If you want to enable AddressSanitizer, useful for finding certain types of bugs, add `CFLAGS='-g -fsanitize=address' LDFLAGS=-fsanitize=address`
  * If you want to rebuild `include/macromagic.h` despite not actually having to, also type `rm include/macromagic.h && make include/macromagic.h`
* Navigate to the newly-created notdnethackdir directory: `cd notdnethackdir`
* Run by typing `./notdnethack`. Wizard mode is `./notdnethack -D -u wizard`
* If you want an rc file (to have custom options and use things like menucolours and autopickup exceptions), edit it via `vim ~/.notdnethackrc` (or your preferred text editor)

For Unix, the same steps apply minus installing WSL.
